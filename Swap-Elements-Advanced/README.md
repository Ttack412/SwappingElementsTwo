## Swap Elements - Advanced
### Description:
In this activity you will be learning about how to swap elements in arrays. You will reverse the order of our character array to show the alphabet forward.
Please follow the steps below:

### Steps:
1. Create a for-each loop that prints the array above with a space between the letters.
2. Create a loop which orders the alphabet correctly. Make sure that this actually changes the order of the array and not just printing out the reverse order. This is called changing the array in place.
3. Create a for-each loop that prints out the letters with a space between them. 

### Test:
Use the test provided. 

#### Sample output:
```
z y x w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a
